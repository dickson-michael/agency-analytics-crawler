# agency-analytics-crawler

This project is a coding test for Agency Analytics, and an excuse to try out the Phalcon MVC framework.

The goal is to create a decoupled crawler for a domain (in this case, agencyanalytics.com) and have it report:
- Number of pages crawled
- Number of a unique images
- Number of unique internal links
- Number of unique external links
- Avg page load
- Avg word count
- Avg Title length
- Table to display each page crawled and it's status code
